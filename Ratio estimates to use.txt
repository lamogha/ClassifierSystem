4:1 1st choice
3:2 = 1.5 2nd choice
5:2	third choice
8:2 OR 
12:3


X:Y = 4:1
Q:R

Q/R should be = X +/- 0.45
R/R should be = Y +/- 0.45

For example: say we have 27:3 as the ratio of similar:unsimilar

Then it must satisfy the ratio statement that 27/3 must be >= 4 +/- 0.44 (if reduced to its smallest form)
for us to say there is closeness. OR will be < 4 +/-0.44 for us to say there is no closeness.
